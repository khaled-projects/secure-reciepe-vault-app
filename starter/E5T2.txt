# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

Tool: Checkov

Description: Checkov is an open-source static analysis tool for infrastructure as code (IaC) that scans Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and ARM templates for misconfigurations and security best practices.

###  Example vulnerability

Violation: Unencrypted S3 Bucket

Description: Checkov can detect if an S3 bucket defined in a CloudFormation template is not configured with server-side encryption.
 This is crucial for protecting data at rest and complying with security standards like PCI-DSS.

##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities

Tool: Trivy

Description: Trivy is a comprehensive and easy-to-use open-source vulnerability scanner for containers. It scans container images for OS vulnerabilities, application dependencies, and config issues.

### Example vulnerability
Vulnerability: CVE-2021-3156 (Sudo Buffer Overflow)

Description: Trivy can detect if a container image includes a version of sudo that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3156, a buffer overflow vulnerability that allows unprivileged users to gain root privileges.
 This is a critical security issue that needs to be addressed to prevent privilege escalation attacks.



##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities

Tool: Prowler

Description: Prowler is an open-source tool that performs AWS security best practices assessments, audits, and hardening checks based on AWS CIS benchmarks and other security frameworks.

#### Example vulnerability
Violation: IAM Policy Too Permissive

Description: Prowler can identify IAM policies that grant overly broad permissions, such as allowing s3:* on all resources. This can lead to potential security risks, as users might have more access than necessary, violating the principle of least privilege.
